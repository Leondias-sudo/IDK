# neco-arc - multifunctional discord bot
## Description
Currently, we use kawaii.red, last.fm's and twitter's API. You must have those API keys inside of config.json. Most polished features are probably /lastfm and /reaction. Both of them are entirierly dynamic. You can edit utils/data.js to modify their usage heavily. All embeds are handled by utils/embedengine.js  

## What features do you have?
- Great last.fm integration
- Twitter tweet sending
- Markov chain generating via js-markov
- Reactions, used for roleplaying or just as a handy gesture (/reaction wave)
- Entirely slash commands, written in updated Discord.js v13!
